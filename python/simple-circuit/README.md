# simple-circuit
Program for modeling current through simple circuits.

## Installation

This program requires Python 3.10 or greater.

To install dependencies, run:

        pip install -r requirements.txt


Requires `tkinter` package. Though many Python distributions come with `tkinter` installed, 
some Linux and MacOS users will need to manually install the `tkinter` package:

Linux: 

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install python3-tk

MacOS: 


        brew install python-tk@3.10
        // Note: the '3.10' indicates the Python version. 
        // Match this to your current Python version, which should be 3.10 or greater.
