#
# Does the code run without error?
# If any error occurs, can you suggest a potential fix?
# Yes, it seems to work well. It does output everything it aims to.

# How understandable is the output of the code?
# Point out any parts you do not understand.
# The output is very readable and clean. I have no issue with the output.

# How readable is the code itself?
# Say where formatting or commenting would make the code more readable or where PEP-8 is violated.
# Honestly, there is very little commenting; this piece could really benefit from comments to explain what the functions
# do. There should be a comment at the top of each function explaining what the function is doing. Also, the naming
# scheme on some variables is unclear. This could be fixed by changing the name of the variables or by providing an
# adequate explanation of what the function does. The code also comes with five weak warnings that could use fixing.
# These are all violations of naming conventions for variables, mostly coming from the variable named "graph".

# How clearly do the code comments describe the problem it is trying to solve?
# Identify places that would benefit from a clearer comment.
# There is almost no commenting, therefore nearly everywhere could benefit from clearer commenting. A great start would
# be providing an explanation for each function and for each variable that is somewhat unclear.

# How clearly do the variable names relate to the concepts they concretize?
# Point out any variables you don't recognize, and/or suggest better names. Check for PEP-8 compliance.
# This is difficult due to the fact that there are no comments for the functions themselves. Perhaps with an
# explanation of each function some variable names would be much more clear. Some that I think could use an update would
# be qx, qy, offset_x, offset_y, layout, and more, although this would depend on what comments get added to explain
# what the code does.

# How well does the range of variables capture the problem described?
# Identify extraneous regions that could be left out or important regions that should be included.
# The problem is not described at all in the code above, so it is hard to say. It is worth noting that the code runs
# very well.

# To what degree does the script follow a functional programming paradigm, packaging all major components of the script
# into separately defined functions that pass information among them in a small number of lines? Identify ways in which
# the functionalization of the code could be improved.
# How clearly do the visualizations show the solutions to the problem?
# The code is broken up into functions very well; there seems to be a function for each thing that needs to be done.
# Perhaps some drawing of shapes could be further optimized by not using such a long list of inputs that aren't very
# clear on why they are like that.

# Say if there is extraneous whitespace or the co-domain or domain of the data should be changed or any other ways the
# visualizations could be more effective
# What could be added is what units each value is in (like volts, and ohms). Maybe also consider putting the voltage
# next to the battery and resistance nest to the resistor. Otherwise, the visualization is very clear.
